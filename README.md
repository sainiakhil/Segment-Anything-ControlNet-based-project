# Project Summary: Image Generation with SAM + ControlNet
This project is an advanced image generation pipeline by integrating several AI models to achieve precise and high-quality results.
1. Segment Anything Model (SAM) + GroundingDINO: Used for precise mask selection, ensuring accurate segmentation.
2. ControlNetModel Canny + StableDiffusionXLControlNetInpaintPipeline: Utilized for generating and inpainting high-quality, realistic images based on the segmented masks.
